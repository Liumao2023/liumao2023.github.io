I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Linguistics at Stony Brook University, expected to graduate in Spring, 2025. 

Before coming to Stony Brook, I received my BA from Southwest University of Science and Technology, China, where I was advised by Professor [Congmei Chen](https://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-BL74EO8J). I received my MA from Nanjing University where I study Pragmatics under the supervision of Professor [Xinren Chen](http://www.cxrlinguistics.com/news/html/?400.html). You can find my current [CV](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive) here.

My research interests include Syntax, Semantics and Chinese Linguistics. I am currently working on my dissertation, titled Derived (Dis-)possessive Predicates in Mandarin Chinese, advised by Professor [Richard Larson](https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/faculty/richard.larson/index.php). In this work, I investigate how a predicate becomes (dis-)possessive when a possessor externalizes. I offer syntactic and semantic evidence to argue that the possessive head has moved into the verbal domain, extending the proposals by Freeze (1992) and Kayne (1993, 1994). 

In my non-academic life, I love playing soccer and badminton. I play soccer for over 20 years and you can find me play soccer in Sinatra Park Field, Resilliancy Park Field, and Sofive. I also love travelling and watching talent shows.

# **Research**

One of the most important advancement in predicative possession, namely _HAVE_, is the proposal that _HAVE_ is the spellout of the incorporation of a possessive head into the existential verb _BE_ (Freeze 1992, Kayne 1993/1994).

(1) John be=POSS a \[father POSS John\].

While existing literature has forcefully shown the feasibility and necessity of possessive incorporation into the existential verb _BE_, my research seeks to extend the incorporation to a wider range of verbs.

The empirical data that I work with is external possession constructions in Mandarin Chinese. While English speakers must say _John’s father died_, Mandarin speakers can also say a structure parallel to _John died father_. I try to answer the following questions:

* Why does the possessor externalize?
* How can a predicate take one more argument?
* How are two cases assigned by an unaccusative?

I approach these questions from the perspective that possessor externalization renders the predicate (dis-)possessive. I show syntactic and semantic properties to show that there is a hidden possessive head in the verbal domain, such that external possession constructions are underlyingly (dis-)possessive constructions. Consequently, the decompositinal approach to predicative possession also applies to Mandarin external possessions.
